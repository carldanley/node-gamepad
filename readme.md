# node-gamepad

> node-gamepad is a package for node that allows you to effortlessly interface your node applications with a variety of gamepad controllers.

## Installation

```js
npm install node-gamepad
```

### Supported Controllers

1. snes/tomee
1. snes/retrolink
1. ps3/dualshock3
1. ps4/dualshock4
1. n64/retrolink
1. logitech/rumblepad2
1. logitech/dualaction
1. logitech/gamepadf310
1. logitech/gamepadf710
1. microsoft/sidewinder-precision-2

## How to Use

Plug in a supported controller and run a variation of the code below (with an actual supported controller):

### Code Example

```js
var GamePad = require( 'node-gamepad' );
var controller = new GamePad( 'supported/controller/here' );
controller.connect();

controller.on( 'up:press', function() {
    console.log( 'up' );
} );
controller.on( 'down:press', function() {
    console.log( 'down' );
} );
```

If you want to use the same configuration for another controller but the vendorID and/or productID is different that the one included in the existing controller dictionary, you can simply pass in an optional second parameter when instantiating the new `GamePad` object:

```js
var GamePad = require( 'node-gamepad' );
var controller = new GamePad( 'supported/controller', {
	vendorID: 1337,
	productID: 1338
} );
controller.connect();
```

Both `vendorID` and `productID` are individually optional key/value pairs you can specify. If they are defined, they will override the ones in the controller's dictionary file, thus allowing you to use the same mapping but with a different product and/or vendor ID.

If you want to be implicit, you can drop the product ID from the controller type specification and node-gamepad will try to automatically detect the proper controller:

```js
var GamePad = require( 'node-gamepad' );
var controller = new GamePad( 'snes' );
```

Please note: it's better to be explicit and specify the exact product ID so you don't run into any confusion with the configuration that's loaded.

## Supported Events

This package supports up to 3 different types of components: joysticks, buttons and statuses (like battery level, charging, etc). It's possible that a controller could make use of all 3 different components or even introduce additional components. The idea here is the dictionary file will dictate how the controller will be used and how to read data from it.

### Joysticks

1. `{name}:move` - When fired, this joystick event will provide an object literal with an `x` and `y` value.

### Buttons

1. `{name}:press` - No data is attached to this callback but it serves the purpose of notifying the developer that a button has been pressed.
1. `{name}:release` - No data is attached to this callback but it serves the purpose of notifying the developer that a button (that was previously pressed) has been released.

### Statuses

A status value is read from a pin on the hardware and then can be mapped to a "state" (based on the dictionary file). See [this example](https://github.com/carldanley/node-gamepad/blob/master/controllers/ps3/dualshock3.json#L136) for more information.

1. `{name}:change`

## Contributing Controllers

You can add controller configuration files to the controllers directory. They are namespaced by `platform/vendor.json`. Each configuration file contains the pins/values mapped to the name of each button, joystick or status. You can use the [hid-mapper](https://www.npmjs.org/package/hid-mapper) tool which will help you create all the necessary mappings to save to your configuration file.
